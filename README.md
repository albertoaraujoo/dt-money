# DT-Money

Web application designed to assist users in financial management.

## üî• Introduction

The project is a tool that helps the user with their financial data. It allows including outputs and inputs, categorizing them, giving them names, and assigning values to them. This is a project from Rocketseat's React.js track. Initially, it was intended to use only React and its hooks like UseContext to manage global states. However, I chose to apply Next.js for the project and Zustand for global states. This is because I wanted to practice these technologies more, which I find very efficient. The project uses TypeScript.

The project also uses some libraries such as Phosphor React for icon usage, Zod for form validation, and React-Hook-Forms for form creation. Additionally, we have two elements from the Radix-UI library, which are Dialog and Radio, used for the new transaction modal. Axios is also used for HTTP requests, and finally, I use JSON.Server to emulate server behavior.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. Additionally, install the MetaMask wallet extension in your browser.

You will also need a code editor, such as VSCode or Sublime Text, to work on the project.

Make sure your development environment is properly configured to work with NextJS14 and Typescript projects.
